Task Automation Prompts

This repository demonstrates semi-automation of a real-world task using prompting.  
Specifically, it converts unstructured meeting notes into structured JSON.

## Structure
- `prompts/` : contains the prompt template(s)
- `examples/` : contains sample inputs and outputs
- `reflections/` : notes on prompt iteration and improvements

## Example Usage
1. Copy the prompt from `prompts/meeting_notes_to_json.txt`.
2. Replace the example notes with your meeting notes.
3. Feed it to a language model to get JSON output.
